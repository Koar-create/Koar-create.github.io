      <h1>Bio</h1>
      <p>
        I am a MPhil student studying at the HKUST Guangzhou (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou Campus). 
        Check <a href="https://cft.hkust-gz.edu.cn/department/red-bird-mphil/">here</a> if you are interested in HKUST Guangzhou's RBM (Red Bird MPhil) program. 
        My aspiration is to pursue a PhD position focusing on topics related to atmospheric modeling, computational fluid dynamics, or their applications in aerospace/unmanned aerial systems.
        <br><br>My supervisor is 
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7c9k148AAAAJ"> Dr. Henry Zhen Liu</a>. Before I entered HKUST Guangzhou, I reveived my Bachelor Degree of Science in Atmospheric Sciences at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), where I finished my bachelor's thesis under the supervision of Dr. Maoqiu Jian.

        Recently, I'm dedicated myself to propose my <u><strong>RBM project</strong></u>. 
        <br><br><strong>üöÅ Project Title:</strong>
        <br>Addressing the Economic and Operational Impacts of Adverse weather on Last-Mile Drone Logistics ‚õàÔ∏è
        <br><br><strong>üî≠ Project Vision:</strong>
        <br>In the burgeoning <strong>Low-Altitude Economy (LAE)</strong>, the full potential of drone delivery is currently capped by a critical vulnerability: adverse weather. This project tackles this challenge head-on. Our goal is to develop an intelligent path-planning system that transforms a drone's operational decisions in poor weather from a simple "go/no-go" to a rich spectrum of strategic flight options. We are not just aiming to avoid risk; we are building a product that enables resilience, expands operational windows, and unlocks new economic possibilities for last-mile logistics.
        By integrating high-resolution Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with predictive data interfaces, we will create a system that empowers drone operators with diverse, safe, and efficient routing choices, turning drone delivery into a truly reliable, all-weather service.

        <strong>üìà Project Update (Last updated: Friday, Oct 17, 12 PM):</strong>
        <br>Our team is actively growing! We are excited to confirm that two 25 MPhil students have already committed to the project: one with an interest in the <strong>EOAS Thrust</strong> (Academic Supervisor: Prof. Zhen Liu) and another focusing on the <strong>SEE Thrust</strong> (Academic Supervisor: Prof. Xiaozhou Fan).
        <br>Furthermore, we are in advanced discussions with two highly promising 25 MPhil students for the <strong>DSA and INTR Thrusts</strong>. We are making great progress towards building a strong, multidisciplinary team.

        <strong>ü§ù Seeking Collaborators to Shape the Future of Drone Logistics:</strong>
        <br>This project is more than research; it's a mission to build a resilient, intelligent, and autonomous drone logistics system that can operate safely even when the weather turns bad.
        <br>We are creating a complete decision-making pipeline: from predicting the physics of the atmosphere, to building a rich digital twin of the city, to architecting the AI brain that makes the final flight decision. To achieve this, I am looking for three core partners to own a critical piece of this vision.

        <strong>We Are Recruiting for Three Core Roles:</strong>
        <br><br><strong>1. The Brain: AI & Optimization Architect</strong>
        <br><strong>(Your background: Operations Research, Route Planning, Reinforcement Learning, Systems Engineering, <u>one of them.</u>)</strong>
        <br>You will be the architect of the project's core decision-making engine. Your mission is to design and implement the dynamic path-planning algorithms that tell the drone where and when to fly. You will consume the rich, high-fidelity risk and performance data from our "World Builder" and transform it into the safest, most efficient flight paths. Your work is the strategic heart of the entire system.
        <br><br><strong>2. The World Builder: Digital Twin & Simulation Specialist</strong>
        <br><strong>(Your background: GIS, 3D Modeling, AIGC, IoT, Robotics, Performance Modeling, <u>one of them.</u>)</strong>
        <br>You will construct the high-fidelity virtual world where our drones are tested to their limits. This role has two critical parts:
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ <strong>Constructing the Stage:</strong>
        You will use your skills in <strong>GIS, 3D modeling, or AIGC</strong> to generate diverse, realistic urban environments that form the testbeds for our simulations.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢ <strong>Defining the Rules:</strong>
        You will build the crucial <strong>"Drone Performance Simulator"</strong>. This involves modeling the physics of the drone itself and translating the raw atmospheric data (from The Physicist) into the precise "cost" and "risk" parameters that The Brain needs to make smart decisions. You are the indispensable bridge between the physical world and the decision engine.
        <br><br><strong>3. The Physicist: Atmospheric & CFD Modeler</strong>
        <br><strong>(Your background: Atmospheric Science, CFD, Fluid Dynamics, e.g., using WRF/Fluent. <u>One of them.</u>)</strong>
        <br>You are the source of truth for our physical world. Your expertise will provide the scientific backbone of the project by generating high-fidelity atmospheric data‚Äîwind, turbulence, and precipitation at the low-altitude, urban scale. This data is the foundational input for the entire system, ensuring every decision our AI makes is grounded in accurate physical reality.
