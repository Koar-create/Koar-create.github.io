      <h1>Bio</h1>
      <p>
        I am a MPhil student studying at the HKUST Guangzhou (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou Campus). 
        Check <a href="https://cft.hkust-gz.edu.cn/department/red-bird-mphil/">here</a> if you are interested in HKUST Guangzhou's RBM (Red Bird MPhil) program. 
        My aspiration is to pursue a PhD position focusing on topics related to atmospheric modeling, computational fluid dynamics, or their applications in aerospace/unmanned aerial systems.
        <br><br>My supervisor is 
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7c9k148AAAAJ"> Dr. Henry Zhen Liu</a>. Before I entered HKUST Guangzhou, I reveived my Bachelor Degree of Science in Atmospheric Sciences at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), where I finished my bachelor's thesis under the supervision of Dr. Maoqiu Jian.

        Recently, I'm dedicated myself to propose my <u><strong>RBM project</strong></u>. 
        <br><br><strong>üöÅ Project Title:</strong>
        <br>Addressing the Economic and Operational Impacts of Adverse weather on Last-Mile Drone Logistics ‚õàÔ∏è
        <br><br><strong>üî≠ Project Vision:</strong>
        <br>In the burgeoning <strong>Low-Altitude Economy (LAE)</strong>, the full potential of drone delivery is currently capped by a critical vulnerability: adverse weather. This project tackles this challenge head-on. Our goal is to develop an intelligent path-planning system that transforms a drone's operational decisions in poor weather from a simple "go/no-go" to a rich spectrum of strategic flight options. We are not just aiming to avoid risk; we are building a product that enables resilience, expands operational windows, and unlocks new economic possibilities for last-mile logistics.
        By integrating high-resolution Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with predictive data interfaces, we will create a system that empowers drone operators with diverse, safe, and efficient routing choices, turning drone delivery into a truly reliable, all-weather service.

        <strong>üìà Project Update (Last updated: Tuesday, Oct 14, 7 PM):</strong>
        <br>Our team is actively growing! We are excited to confirm that two 25 MPhil students have already committed to the project: one with an interest in the <strong>EOAS Thrust</strong> (Academic Supervisor: Prof. Zhen Liu) and another focusing on the <strong>SEE Thrust</strong> (Academic Supervisor: Prof. Xiaozhou Fan).
        <br>Furthermore, we are in advanced discussions with two highly promising 25 MPhil students for the <strong>INTR Thrust</strong>. We are making great progress towards building a strong, multidisciplinary team.

        <strong>ü§ù Seeking Collaborators to Shape the Future of Drone Logistics:</strong>
        <br>This project is a multidisciplinary effort to build the next generation of autonomous logistic systems. We are creating a clear data pipeline: from atmospheric modeling to risk quantification, and finally to intelligent path planning. I am looking for innovative and driven colleagues to own a critical piece of this pipeline. Your contribution will be vital:
        <br><br><strong>‚Ä¢ UAV Performance & Risk Quantification (AI / DSA / IoT / ROAS Thrust):</strong>
        This is a core role that forms the bridge between weather data and decision-making. Our path-planning algorithms need to know: what is the real "cost" (energy use, time, risk) of flying a specific route in adverse weather? Your mission will be to build the <strong>"Drone Performance Simulator"</strong> that answers this. By modeling the interaction between the drone's physics and the atmospheric data (from the EOAS/SEE team, see below), you will produce the precise risk and cost parameters that are the foundational input for the entire path-planning engine. Your work is not real-time control; it is creating the indispensable predictive model that makes intelligent pre-flight planning possible.
        <br><br><strong>‚Ä¢ UAV Path Planning & Systems Engineering (INTR / IoT / ROAS Thrust):</strong>
        As the architect of the project's core decision-making engine, you will design and implement the dynamic path-planning algorithms. You will take the precise risk and performance parameters generated by our Drone Performance Simulator and use them to find the safest and most efficient flight paths. Your expertise in optimization and UAV systems will be essential in developing the high-level strategies that allow a drone to intelligently navigate complex weather scenarios.
        <br><br><strong>‚Ä¢ Atmospheric & Low-Altitude Airflow Modeling (EOAS / SEE Thrust):</strong>
        You will provide the scientific backbone of the project. Your work in modeling and simulating low-altitude fluid dynamics will generate the high-fidelity atmospheric data‚Äîwind, turbulence, and precipitation. This data is the critical input that feeds directly into our risk quantification and path-planning modules, ensuring our entire system is grounded in accurate physical reality.
        <br><br><strong>‚Ä¢ AI-driven 3D Scene Generation (AI / DSA Thrust):</strong>
        Our simulations require diverse, high-fidelity urban environments. We need an expert in AIGC for 3D to generate these critical virtual testbeds. Your work will directly enable us to scale and validate our resilience strategies across countless realistic scenarios, forming the very foundation of the project's data-driven approach.
