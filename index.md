      <h1>Bio</h1>
      <p>
        I am a MPhil student studying at the HKUST Guangzhou (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou Campus). 
        Check <a href="https://cft.hkust-gz.edu.cn/department/red-bird-mphil/">here</a> if you are interested in HKUST Guangzhou's RBM (Red Bird MPhil) program. 
        My aspiration is to pursue a PhD position focusing on topics related to atmospheric modeling, computational fluid dynamics, or their applications in aerospace/unmanned aerial systems.
        <br><br>My supervisor is 
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7c9k148AAAAJ"> Dr. Henry Zhen Liu</a>. Before I entered HKUST Guangzhou, I reveived my Bachelor Degree of Science in Atmospheric Sciences at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), where I finished my bachelor's thesis under the supervision of Dr. Maoqiu Jian.

        Recently, I'm dedicated myself to propose my <u><strong>RBM project</strong></u>. 
        <br><br><strong>üöÅ Project Title:</strong>
        <br>Addressing the Economic and Operational Impacts of Adverse weather on Last-Mile Drone Logistics ‚õàÔ∏è: Building a Resilient Digital Twin for Urban Drone Logistics
        <br><br><strong>üî≠ Project Vision: From Go/No-Go to Intelligent, All-Weather Operations</strong>
        <br>In the burgeoning <strong>Low-Altitude Economy (LAE)</strong>, the full potential of drone delivery is currently capped by a critical vulnerability: adverse weather. This project tackles this challenge head-on by moving beyond simple "go/no-go" decisions. Our goal is to develop an intelligent, multi-layered digital twin that empowers drone operators with a rich spectrum of strategic flight options in complex urban airspace.
        <br>This initiative is more than just an engineering challenge; it is a mission to build a <strong>Digital Twin Policy Lab</strong>. By fusing high-fidelity atmospheric science, robust flight simulation, and insightful urban analytics, we aim to translate complex physical data into actionable policy and economic insights. We are not just building a risk-avoidance tool; we are creating a system that enables resilience, expands operational windows, and unlocks new economic possibilities for last-mile logistics, turning drone delivery into a truly reliable, all-weather service.

        <strong>workflow End-to-End Validated Workflow</strong>
        <br><br>Our project is built upon a technically feasible and meticulously planned workflow that ensures seamless integration across interdisciplinary modules. The process transforms raw geospatial and meteorological data into a high-fidelity, interactive digital twin, allowing for robust analysis and decision-making.

        <strong>üìà Project Update (Last updated: Friday, Oct 18, 4 PM):</strong>
        <br>Our team is actively growing! We are excited to confirm that two 25 MPhil students have already committed to the project: one with an interest in the <strong>EOAS Thrust</strong> (Academic Supervisor: Prof. Zhen Liu) and another focusing on the <strong>SEE Thrust</strong> (Academic Supervisor: Prof. Xiaozhou Fan).
        <br>Furthermore, we are in advanced discussions with two highly promising 25 MPhil students for the <strong>INTR Thrust</strong>. We are making great progress towards building a strong, multidisciplinary team.

        <strong>ü§ù Seeking Collaborators to Shape the Future of Drone Logistics:</strong>
        <br>This project is a mission to build a resilient, intelligent, and autonomous drone logistics system that can operate safely even when the weather turns bad. To achieve this, we are looking for core partners to own a critical piece of this vision. We are recruiting for the following roles:
