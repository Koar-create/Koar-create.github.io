      <h1>Bio</h1>
      <p>
        I am a MPhil student studying at the HKUST-GZ (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou). 
        Check <a href="https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/education-innovation/red-bird-mphil-program/">here</a> if you are interested in HKUST (Guangzhou)'s Red Bird MPhil program. 
        My aspiration is to pursue a PhD position focusing on topics related to atmospheric modeling, computational fluid dynamics, or their applications in aerospace/unmanned aerial systems. 
        <br><br>My supervisor is 
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7c9k148AAAAJ"> Dr. Henry Zhen Liu</a>. Before I entered HKUST (Guangzhou), I reveived my Bachelor Degree of Science in Atmospheric Sciences at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), where I finished my bachelor's thesis under the supervision of Dr. Maoqiu Jian.
        <br><br>Recently, I'm dedicated myself to propose my Red Bird MPhil project. 
        My primary research interest lies in <u>enhancing the resilience of drone delivery services to adverse weather</u>. My methodology involves using high-resolution Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to quantify the risks posed by mildly adverse weather, and integrating this data with route planning software to create safer, more reliable flight paths.
        <br><br>This work is highly interdisciplinary, and I am keen to collaborate with <u>excellent colleagues in the following areas</u>:
        <br><strong>• Intelligent Transportation (INTR Thrust) & UAV/VTOL Engineering (INTR/ROAS Thrust):</strong>
        Seeking partners with knowledge/expertise in industrial-standard drone and VTOL hardware and control systems to bridge the gap between atmospheric modeling and real-world vehicle dynamics.
        <br><br><strong>• Carbon Neutrality (CNCC Thrust) & Sustainability (SEE Thrust):</strong>
        I am interested in developing methodologies to quantify the carbon footprint of expanded drone operations, contributing to life cycle assessments and supporting carbon neutrality goals.
        <br><br><strong>• Sustainable Energy (SEE Thrust):</strong>
        As we broaden the operational scenarios for drone delivery, I believe a critical next step is the optimization of energy consumption for these new routes, aligning logistical efficiency with environmental sustainability.
        <br><br>Feel free to <a href="mailto:zyang248@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn?Subject=Hello">contact me</a> if you are interested in my research.
