    My current work focuses on the numerical model WRFâ€™s reproducibility and performance during a record-breaking precipitation event happened during September 7 to 8 in 2023 at the Greater Bay Area (GBA) region. About 260 experiments have been conducted, and most experiments underestimate the peak precipitation. Evaluation are based on station records offered by the China's Meteorological Administration during the event.

    All the experiments are classified into two categories: Captured and Uncaptured events, based on certain metric: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of precipitation between simulation and observation. On the basis of classification, the composites of captured and uncaptured events are visualized and compared, so as to identify the key factor which leads to the underestimate of peak precipitation.

    This work needs further experiment designing.
